## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

The Retro-Carnage team is a group of volunteer computer nerds who are interested in retro games. We have set ourselves the goal of breathing new life into one of the most beautiful genres: multidirectional scrolling shooters. In the days of the Commodore Amiga 500, a whole series of video game classics of this genre were created, such as Ikari Warriors by SNK, War Zone by Core Design, or Dogs of War by Elite Systems. Our goal is to create a modern, platform-independent game called Retro-Carnage as a worthy successor to these classics.

🌈 Contribution guidelines

Any help is very welcome - and it is very easy to get involved. If you would like to develop software, the [technical documentation](https://www.retro-carnage.net/en/development/) on the [homepage of Retro-Carnage](https://www.retro-carnage.net) will give you an overview of the various components of the project. These modules have been implemented in a variety of programming languages for the sheer joy of technology. There is bound to be something exciting for you.

If you like drawing or produce digital art, you will find files in the asset repositories (or the application directory of the game) that you can easily exchange. This way you can give the game the look you would like to see.

You can also help us without a lot of work, for example by trying out the game and giving us feedback and [reporting bugs](https://github.com/Retro-Carnage-Team/retro-carnage/issues).
